# üåê URL Health Monitor App (with Local LLM Summary)

This is a Streamlit-based web application that monitors the health (availability and response time) of one or more URLs. It logs results in a local SQLite database and optionally summarizes them using a locally running LLM like **TinyLlama via Ollama** ‚Äî ensuring full privacy and offline functionality.
